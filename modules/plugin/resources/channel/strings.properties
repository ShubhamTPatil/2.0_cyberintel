# This file is meant for the defining the strings which are externalized from the subscription plugin classes
# or its dependent classes for the purpose of i18n. As of 6.0.3 we don't have strings to externalize for the classes
# running in plugin context. This file is added to keep things consistent with rest of i18n changes.
# For example, if strings are added which are to be externalized in LDAPEnv class, we need to add the strings
# in CommonErrors.properties and modify the build enviornment to copy these entries to this file. This file will be
# part of subconfig.zip along with loig.properties file.
