firefox.profile.1.title=Upstream Firefox STIG
firefox.profile.1.description=This profile is developed under the DoD consensus model and DISA FSO Vendor STIG process, serving as the upstream development environment for the Firefox STIG. As a result of the upstream/downstream relationship between the SCAP Security Guide project and the official DISA FSO STIG baseline, users should expect variance between SSG and DISA FSO content. For official DISA FSO STIG content, refer to http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/app-security/browser-guidance/Pages/index.aspx. While this profile is packaged by Red Hat as part of the SCAP Security Guide package, please note that commercial support of this SCAP content is NOT available. This profile is provided as example SCAP content with no endorsement for suitability or production readiness. Support for this profile is provided by the upstream SCAP Security Guide community on a best-effort basis. The upstream project homepage is https://fedorahosted.org/scap-security-guide/.
